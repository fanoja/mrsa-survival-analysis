# MRSA Bayesian Survival Analysis

Analysis code for the manuscript *Bayesian modeling of the impact of antibiotic resistance on the efficiency of MRSA decolonization*


## Requirements

R4.0.5 

Packages:
- rstanarm
- bayesplot
- igraph
- network
- reshape2
- ggplot2
- gridExtra
- cowplot

To gain access to stan_surv function for survival analysis, install the developlment version of [rstanarm from GitHub](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm). For this, packages `rstan` and `remotes` are also required. If you have installation issues, revert to R4.0.5 as suggested in this [issue](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/issues/500#issuecomment-1203904085).

For package management, [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) is used. Check an introduction to renv [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

## Structure

### Directories
- `data/`: SNP distance data (dfst5, dfst8), MRSA survival data with resistances and clearance
- `results/`: Figures and tables from the article as generated by this code
- `saved_models/`: Save fitted models here for visualization.
- `kfold/`: Results for K-fold Cross-Validation
- `scripts/`: R scripts necessary for the analysis.
- `scripts/cluster/`: Scripts to fit the Bayesian model on a computing cluster.
- `strains/`: Files associated with assigning strains to the isolates (see [BaeMBac](https://github.com/mjarvenpaa/bacterial-colonization-model))


### Data
- Data in survival analysis compatible format should be included in the directory `data/strain_surv_data`. The following files are required:
    - `data.RData`: data "pooled" over sites
    - `data_sites.RData`: site-specific survival data
    - `treatments.RData`: contains the names of the antimicrobials of interest

### Jupyter notebooks
- `MRSA Clearance.ipynb`: Generation of all figures in the manuscript, instructions to running the analysis with examples.

### Source code
- surv_preprocessing_strains.R: Preprocess the data to a survival analysis format
- mdata_preprocessing.R: Preprocessing the data prior to creating a survival analysis compatible dataset
- mcmc_plotting_functions.R: Various functions to visualize the data and results
- get_model_functions.R: Various functions for running the models 
- utilities.R: Utility functions
